# StudentHelper
Java+JavaFX

It's the app I intended to make to help new students of my university with their assignments.

At first, I wanted to make it cost 25$, but then I decided I'd rather put it out for free to get attention.

I still question some of my design and I am more likely to change plenty of stuff that's already written.
